# Queen’s Indian Defense - Basic Theory

In typical hypermodern style, black won’t occupy the center with pawns but instead focuses on piece development. If white avoids the Nimzo-Indian Defense with 3.Nf3, black will fianchetto their queen’s bishop with the idea to control the light central squares, particularly the e4-square. Since black’s position will be a bit cramped, black will usually try to exchange a few minor pieces in order to create a bit more space. However, white can get a good position if they can control the e4-square in a favorable manner.
A popular variation in the Queen’s Indian Defense is the Fianchetto Variation.
