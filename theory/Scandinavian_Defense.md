# Scandinavian Defense - Basic Theory

1.e4 d5, the Scandinavian Defense, appears to be a very attacking opening for black. However, it is in fact rather passive, at least in the early stages of the game. Black’s development will be slow and white can develop freely. However, since the opening is also very solid for black (because they have no weaknesses in their pawn-structure), it will be difficult for white to plan an attack. At a later stage then, black can aim to take advantage of any weaknesses in white’s structure.
A popular variation in the Scandinavian Defense is the Main Line.
