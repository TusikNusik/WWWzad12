# King’s Indian Defense (KID) - Basic Theory

The King’s Indian Defense follow hypermodern principles. That is, black allows White to build a strong pawn center to later counter-attack it with a pawn-push, either e5 or c5. Black will support the pawn-push with their minor pieces, prominently the fianchettoed bishop on g7.
A popular variation in the King’s Indian Defense is the Classical Variation.
