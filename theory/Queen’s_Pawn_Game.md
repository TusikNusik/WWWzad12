# Queen’s Pawn Game - Basic Theory

The family of Queen’s Pawn Openings usually leads to slower development (as compared to King’s Pawn Openings). One reason for this is that the pawn on d4 is already defended 9by the queen), whereas with 1.e4, the pawn would not be defended yet. This implies that Queen’s Pawn Openings are generally, but not always, less tactical and more strategic in nature than King’s Pawn Opening. On the other hand, Queen’s Pawn Openings can give white a little more time to play for strategic advantages.
A popular variation in the Queen’s Pawn Game is the Anti-Nimzo-Indian.
