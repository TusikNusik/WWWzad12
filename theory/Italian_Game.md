# Italian Game - Basic Theory

The Italian Game is one of the oldest recorded openings and it is easy to see why. According to classical principles (control the centre, develop quickly, castle soon) there is hardly a simpler example of achieving these objectives, than 1.e4, 2.Nf3 and 3.Bc4.
Two popular variations in the Italian Game is the Giuoco Piano (translated “quiet game”) and the Giuoco Pianissimo (translated “very quiet game”).
