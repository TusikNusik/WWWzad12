# Petrov’s Defense - Basic Theory

By keeping the game absolutely symmetrical, black can achieve a very solid, albeit drawish, position. In high-level games, black will usually play the Petrov only if they will be happy with a draw. The player with the black pieces may also use this opening if they want to tempt their opponent to overreach.
A popular variation in Petrov’s Defense is the Classical Variation.
