# Colle System - Basic Theory

Whiteâ€™s first goal is to reach the Colle System setup (d4, Nf3, e3, c3, Bd3, Nbd2 and 0-0) after which white will decide on a plan depending on how black develops.
A popular variation in the Colle System is the Traditional Colle (which actually refers to the way black chooses to respond, specifically to play c5, whilst white still goes for the standard Colle System setup).
