# Benoni Defense - Basic Theory

In the Benoni Defence, black’s overarching strategy is to create significant imbalances in the position. Imbalances will create more dynamic opportunities and thus black will get more winning chances than they would typically get from a more solid response. This benefit comes, of course, at the cost of increased losing chances too! That is why top chess players favor this opening in “must-win” match situations.
Note:After 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5, white doesn’t win a pawn with 3.dxc5 because 3… e6, followed by Bxc5 will only help black. Alternatively, 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.dxc5 e6 4.b4 a5! is even better for black.
A popular variation in the Benoni opening is the Modern Variation.
