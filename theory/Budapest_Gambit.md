# Budapest Gambit - Basic Theory

The Budapest Gambit is mostly used as a surprise weapon against people who are probably not up to date with the theory of the opening. It is a very aggressive approach by black, challenging the centre from the word go and potentially launching an all-out attack on the white. White shouldnâ€™t try to keep their pawn on e5 as this will help black. Instead, white should aim to give back the pawn on favorable terms, for example gaining the bishop pair or forcing black to waste time regaining the pawn.
A popular variation in the Budapest Gambit is the Rubinstein Variation.
