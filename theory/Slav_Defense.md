# Slav Defense - Basic Theory

The theory of the Slav Defense was developed by top players who longed for a solid opening against one of white’s most popular openings, the Queen’s Gambit. One problem they had to solve, was the fact that many other defenses rely on an early e7-e6, resulting in a bad light-squared bishop (stuck behind the e6-pawn). In the main lines of the Slav Defense, black overcomes this problem by supporting the d5-pawn with their c-pawn, instead of the e-pawn, making it possible for the light-square bishop to develop freely.
A popular variation in the Slav Defense is the Semi-Slav.
