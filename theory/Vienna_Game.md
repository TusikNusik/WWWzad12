# Vienna Game - Basic Theory

In the Vienna Game opening, white does not play the almost expected 2.Nf3, but instead develops the other knight, 3.Nc3, with the intent to possibly play f2-f4 on the 3rd move. In some variations then, the Vienna Game can be seen as a delayed Kingâ€™s Gambit.
A popular variation in the Vienna Game is the Mieses Variation.
