# Alekhine’s Defense - Basic Theory

The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, the fourth world champion, who played it in two of his games in a tournament in Budapest, 1921.
Alekhine’s Defense is ahypermodern openingfrom black’s perspective. Black dares white to grab space in the center with the moves 2.e5 Nd5 3.c4. Black then intends to attack and undermine white’s central pawns. However, if white manages to effectively support their central pawns, white will enjoy a strong advantage in the center.
A common variation in the Alekhine Defense Opening is The Modern Variation.
