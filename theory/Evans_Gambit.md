# Evans Gambit - Basic Theory

In typical gambit style, white sacrifices a pawn, with b2-b4, in order to get ahead in development. An important observation is that other gambits often sacrifice a pawn near the centre. In the case of Evans Gambit, white still has all their central pawns.
A popular variation in the Evans Gambit is the Evans Gambit Accepted.
