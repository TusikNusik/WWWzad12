# Queen’s Gambit - Basic Theory

Although the Queen’s Gambit is a very dynamic opening, the concept behind it is simple and logical: White wants to exchange their flank-pawn (c-pawn) for a central pawn (d-pawn). If black accepts the gambit, white will then have two central pawns against black’s one central pawn. The Queen’s Gambit is not a true gambit opening though, because white will typically regain the pawn since black can’t hold onto it in a favorable manner.

When black accepts the gambit, they generally also accept that they will not try to save the pawn. Instead, black will focus on development and typically plan to gain time and space on the queen-side.
A popular variation in the Queen’s Gambit Accepted is the Main Line.
