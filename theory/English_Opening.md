# English Opening - Basic Theory

The English Opening is an opening for white that starts with the move 1.c4. In a pure English opening, white will aim to control the d5-square, with the help of a bishop on g2 and another pawn on e4, supported by a pawn on d3.
However, the English opening often transposes into another opening, such as theQueen’s Gambitor theCatalan Opening.
Note:In chess, transposition is the scenario where the exact same position is reached, but by a different sequence of moves. For example, the English Opening will often transpose into a variation of the Queen’s Gambit.
A popular variation in the English Opening is the Anglo Indian Defense.
