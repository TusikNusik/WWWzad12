# Réti Opening - Basic Theory

Unlike most other openings, the Réti is not a specific but rather a set of themes that characterize the opening. In modern times the Réti Opening refers to white playing Nf3, c4, fianchettoes at least one bishop and does not play an early d4. whereas black plays 1…d5.
A popular variation in the Réti Opening is the Queen’s Gambit (Transposed).
