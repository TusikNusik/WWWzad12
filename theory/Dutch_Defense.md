# Dutch Defense - Basic Theory

With 1… f5, black aims to dominate the light-squares, fundamentally the e4-square. The thinking is that since white played 1.d4, the e4-square becomes a sensible target. Black will also have flexibility as to how they will play in the centre with the d-and-e-pawns. However, black must accept that 1… f5 weakens their king-side.
A popular variation in the Dutch Defense is the Fianchetto Attack.
