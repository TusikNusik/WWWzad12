# French Defense - Basic Theory

In the French defense the purpose of black’s first move, e6, is to support the d5-square from where black intends to challenge the centre. Also, by playing e6, black’s king is immediately safer since white will not be able to attack on the g8-a2-diagonal anytime soon.
A popular variation in the French Defense is the Winawer Variation.
