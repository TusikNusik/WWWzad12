# King’s Indian Attack (KIA) - Basic Theory

The King’s Indian Attack is often characterized by an all out attack on black’s king-side.
However, before they can attack, white typically aims to:
Develop the pieces and get their king safe (castle).Get a pawn to e5 from where it gives white a space-advantage on the kingside (if black has a pawn on e5, white usually wants to attack it–by preparing to play f2-f4).White’s usually avoids pointless piece-exchanges early on–they need the pieces to attack.
However, white should be flexible too. Depending how black plays, white may decide to rather focus on the center or expand on the queen-side.
A popular variation in the King’s Indian Attack is the Yugoslav Variation.
