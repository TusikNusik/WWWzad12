# Bird’s Opening - Basic Theory

The Bird’s Opening is named after British master Henry Edward Bird, who played the opening throughout his chess career in the mid-nineteenth century.
The Bird’s opening is an aggressive, imbalanced and rather unusual opening where white aims to control the e5-square, possibly with the help of a fianchettoed bishop on b2. The opening generally offers good attacking chances to white but comes at the cost of weakening their own king-side.
A popular response by black is 1… d5, known as the Dutch Variation of the Bird’s Opening.
