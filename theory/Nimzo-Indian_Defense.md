# Nimzo-Indian Defense - Basic Theory

In the Nimzo-Indian Defense, black wants to control the e4-squareand all their efforts will support this strategy. Since the white knight on c3 will be a key defender of the e4-square, black wants to exchange their dark-square bishop for this knight. Once this first objective is achieved, Black will also try to keep the position closed because white will have the bishop-pair. (Bishops prefer open positions.)
The Nimzo-Indian Defense is a highly respected opening, to the extent that white sometimes chooses to play the Anti-Nimzo-Indian, where white delays 3.Nc3 (in favor of 3.Nf3) in order to avoid the Nimzo-Indian.
A popular variation in the Nimzo-Indian Defense is the Rubinstein Variation.
