# Ruy Lopez - Basic Theory

After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6, the move 3.Bb5 is the Ruy Lopez. At its most basic level, the purpose of this move is to add pressure on the e5-square by attacking its main defender (the knight on c6). White is even threatening to win the pawn on e5. It doesn’t work right away though, because after 3… a6 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.Nxe5, black can play 5… Qd4, attacking the white knight and pawn on e4.
A popular variation in the Ruy Lopez is the Closed Defense.
