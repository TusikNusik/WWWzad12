# Two Knights Defense - Basic Theory

If black plays the Two Knights Defense, they are (usually) either ignorant of the Fried Liver Attack, or they want to tempt white to try it. If white isn’t tempted though, the game will most likely transpose into a variation of the Italian Game, Giuoco Pianissimo.
Note:If black wants to play the Two Knights Defense, it is imperative that they know how to deal with the Fried Liver Attack.
Fried Liver Attack
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nc6 4.Ng5!? threatening Nxf7.

Black must be very well versed in the theory of the Fried Liver Attack if they want to survive the onslaught. For example, after 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5? (Na5 is correct) 6.Nxf7!? Kxf7 7.Qf3+ black is in an almost losing position.
Note that if black played 3… Bc5, then 4.Ng5? can be met with Qxg5. Or 3… Bc5 4.Nc3 Nf6 5.Ng5 0-0 is good for black.,
