# Sicilian Defense - Basic Theory

In the Sicilian Defense, black upsets the balance in the position on their very first move, which declares they are ready for a fight.
The Sicilian Defense is a counter-attacking opening where the players typically attack on opposite sides of the board. Black typically expands on the queen-side with …a6 and …b5, and play along the semi-open c-file. And since black’s c-pawn has moved, black will typically castle to the short side. White, on the other hand, will seek to crash through the centre–into black’s position–or potentially launch an attack on black’s king-side. White’s strategy will be very effective if black fails to defend the centre.
A popular variation in the opening is the Sicilian Defense is the Najdorf Variation.
