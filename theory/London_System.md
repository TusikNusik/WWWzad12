# London System - Basic Theory

In The London System (also known as the Mason Variation of the Queen’s Pawn Game), white sticks to the same setup, almost regardless of what Black plays. As with all opening systems, the theory and move order is not as important as it would be in non-system type openings.
White will give a lot of support to their pawn on d4 (c3,e3,Nf3). Their pawn-formation in the centre will exert substantial control over the dark squares. Since black’s dark-square bishop will play an important role in defending dark squares, white will often aim to exchange their dark-square bishop for its black counterpart, quite possibly on d6.
A popular variation in the London System is the Main Line.
Note:The Main Line Variation of a particular opening may not always remain the most popular. The popularity of opening variations can change over time. Top-level trends, new discoveries, novelties or refutations of existing variations can all affect its popularity.
