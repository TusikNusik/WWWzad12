# Torre Attack - Basic Theory

The Torre Attack is a system opening that is in fact very similar to the London System. In the Torre Attack, whiteâ€™s dark-square bishop goes to g5 (in the London System this bishop goes to f4). White aims to occupy the center with pawns and prepares to play e3-e4 once the square is supported from a knight on d2, a bishop on d3 and, possibly, a rook on e1. Another common idea is to attack on the kingside, starting with Ne5 and then f4.
A popular variation in the Torre Attack is the Classical Defense.
