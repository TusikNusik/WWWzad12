# Four Knights Game - Basic Theory

Four Knights Game is a very principled opening, featuring very natural development from both sides. Both players develop their knights before the bishops. This is a little more flexible because, whereas the knights generally go to the c-and-f-files, it is a little less obvious where the bishops will go.
A popular variation in the Four Knights Game is the Double Spanish Variation (also known as the Symmetrical Variation).
