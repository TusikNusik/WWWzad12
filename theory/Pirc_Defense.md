# Pirc Defense - Basic Theory

The Pirc Defense is another example of hypermodern defense, meaning that black allows white to occupy the centre with their pawns. Black’s strategy will then be to attack white’s center with their minor pieces and to prepare the right moment for counter-strike in the centre. As a consequence of playing d6, black’s dark-square bishop must fianchetto to the g7-square in order to develop.
A popular variation in the Pirc Defense is the Classical Variation.
